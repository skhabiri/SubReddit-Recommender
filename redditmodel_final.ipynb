    "# Hash\n",
    "A hash is an fixed sized integer that identifies a particular value. Each value needs to have its own hash, so for the same value you will get the same hash even if it's not the same object. Furthermore hash of an integer is the same integer.\n",
    "hash() is used for comparing objects. An object is deemed hashable if it can be compared to other objects. hash() is also used to access dict and set elements which are implemented as resizable hash tables in CPython.\n",
    "Technically speaking:\n",
    "* Usually comparing objects (which may involve several levels of recursion) is expensive.\n",
    "* preferably, the hash() function is an order of magnitude (or several) less expensive.\n",
    "* comparing two hashes is easier than comparing two objects, this is where the shortcut is.\n",
    "* The python dict is a hashmap, its worst case is therefore O(n) if we have hash collision. However that is a very rare case where every item added has the same hash and so is added to the same chain. Hence, the average time complexity is still O(1). check [Time Complexity](http://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity) for more.\n",
    "* An object is hashable if [1] it has a hash value which never changes during its lifetime (it needs a __hash__() method), and can be compared to other objects (it needs an __eq__() method). [2] Hashable objects which compare equal must have the same hash value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> hash(\"Look at me!\")\n",
    "4343814758193556824\n",
    ">>> f = \"Look at me!\"\n",
    ">>> hash(f)\n",
    "4343814758193556824\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hash values need to be created in such a way that the resulting values are evenly distributed to reduce the number of hash collisions you get. Hash collisions are when two different values have the same hash. Therefore, relatively small changes often result in very different hashes.\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> hash(\"Look at me!!\")\n",
    "6941904779894686356\n",
    "```\n",
    "These numbers are very useful, as they enable quick look-up of values in a large collection of values. Two examples of their use are Python's `set` and `dict`. In a `list`, if you want to check if a value is in the list, with `if x in values:`, Python needs to go through the whole list and compare `x` with each value in the list values. This can take a long time for a long list. In a set, Python keeps track of each hash, and when you type `if x in values:`, Python will get the hash-value for `x`, look that up in an internal structure and then only compare `x` with the values that have the same hash as `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same methodology is used for dictionary lookup. **This makes lookup in set and dict very fast, while lookup in list is slow. It also means you can have non-hashable objects in a list, but not in a set or as keys in a dict.** The typical example of non-hashable objects is any object that is **mutable**, meaning that you can change its value. If you have a mutable object it should not be hashable, as its hash then will change over its life-time, which would cause a lot of confusion, as an object could end up under the wrong hash value in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the hash of a value only needs to be the same for one run of Python. In Python 3.3 they will in fact change for every new run of Python:\n",

    "### Why mutable object shouldn't be hashable:\n",
    "the short answer is that if the object's value changes, then the hash must also change since hashes are based on values. However, if the object's value changes after it's used as a key in a dictionary, the hash will no longer refer to the correct bucket in the dictionary for that key. Let's use an example. Watch Brandon Rhode's PyCon 2010 talk [The Mighty Dictionary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4Kc8xzcA68) about how dictioneries work in python. Let's use an example.\n",
