We have a mortgage, one car payment, boat payment, $8000 in CC debt, and he did have a small student loan balance. Between his ESOP and IRAs he has about $200,000.00 and we had a small life Insurance policy on him through my work of $12,000.\n\nI will be selling the house, boat, and one of the vehicles and I may just pay off all the cc debt, but I don’t want to make any rash decisions.\n\nI’m so lost.\n\nEdit/Update: Thank you all so much for this information. A little more info on our full situation. My husband and I live in  Alaska in a more remote area and it was just the two of us. He died while running a 10k and I saw him about 3 minutes before and he was ecstatic and smiling and gave me a thumbs up. Both of our families live in New Mexico, so I will be moving back there. The boat was just a pleasure boat we'd use on the ocean and luckily it's a very sought after boat in this state so it should move quickly. We have one truck that is paid off and I will be selling that and keeping my Subaru. I went ahead and canceled all of the auto payments on his credit cards and I've already begun paperwork on IRA's and the life insurance policy. I'm fortunate that my family has means and are able to help me right now. My parents arrived the day after he died and his Dad and sister arrived Tuesday night, so I have a wonderful support network. I have about 13000 liquid with about 7000 more coming in so I'll be able to make the mortgage payment, car, etc. while we're waiting to clear things out. The ESOP is not paid out until a year after the event and my Dad has already contacted his financial advisor to help me navigate what to do with the money as well as not to be hit hard with taxes. I'll also be able to receive his Permanent Fund Dividend this year which is good since I guess it's supposed to be a whopper. I feel so fortunate that we somewhat had our shit together. My husband and I were both socking money away into our retirement accounts and we had a modest home so we could have lots of adventures, which we did. We lived without regrets and that is really helping me right now. Well I guess I slightly misspoke, I wish we did have more life insurance, but hindsights always 20/20. If anyone can learn anything from my situation it is this: Life is fleeting. Live everyday to the fullest. My husband and I went on adventures nearly every weekend. Whether it be hiking, backpacking, bike-packing, boating, fishing, hunting, traveling, we were always doing something. We told each other numerous times a day that we loved each other and we were each others world. I will get through this and I will continue to accomplish the goals that we shared together. Life through me a shitty surprise, but it's not the end of the world. I will get better. My beloved loved to tell me to get my shit together when I was being a whiny pants and that's just what I'm going to do. Also, because I'm selfish in my grief and if anyone is interested to learn more about my [amazing husband](https://www.sewardjournal.com/eedition/page/page_643cb6a9-a712-5261-8d3f-323e2b159dae.html), I wrote a letter of thanks and it's been published in two papers.</td></tr><tr><th>4</th><td>Fitness</td><td>2qhx4</td><td>My High School Transformation! 185 lb Fat Freshman to 155 lb Fit Senior</td><td>At the end of my Freshman year of high school, I weighed in at nearly 190-200 lbs and hated how I looked. That summer, I decided to lose some weight, and got all the way down to 130 lbs! Unfortunately, in my sophomore year, I had developed anorexia and an  even more severe body dysmorphia problem. In my Junior year, I started lifting weights and was slowly able to overcome my terrible relationship with food, gaining a decent amount of muscle but also a decent amount of fat. Today, I am a Senior, and am finally coming to love the way I look. I have an amazing relationship with food, love to workout, and am starting to like the way I look! So please, if you have any questions, feel free to ask about my journey!\n\nMore specific information:\n\nStarting weight: 190-200 lbs\nStarting Height: 5’7\nAge: 15\n\nCurrent Weight: 155 lbs \nCurrent Height: 5’7\nCurrent Age: 18\n\nWorkout program:\nI played a lot of sports during 9-10th grade, but in 11th I started lifting everyday. I alternated between the PPLx2 program and Layne Norton’s PHAT.  Mostly PPLx2 though. \n\nDiet: \nI basically ate all clean foods, aka “bro foods.” I counted out my calories/macros to a T, and still continue to do that. When I wanted to lose weight, I was in a caloric deficit, and when I wanted to gain, I upped the calories and whatnot. \n\n\n [Transformation Pictures](https://imgur.com/gallery/qTqEK)\n\n[More pics](https://imgur.com/gallery/beszu) \n\n\n** You may notice that I don’t look very lean in the picture on the right, and that is partly due to me have a little fat left, but also a fair amount of loose skin. Can’t tell in the picture, but I can actually pull it out quite a bit. Covers all of my abs, unfortunately. Haha</td></tr></tbody></table>
