He's been occasionally asking me, from the other room, the answers to different math problems, like what's 12+7 or what's 22-8.  I'm like sweet he's doing his math! Nope. He's trying to bypass the parental locks on kids YouTube so he can watch shit that is blocked. He keeps exiting out and going back in which is I assume why he had to ask multiple times.</td></tr></tbody></table>
